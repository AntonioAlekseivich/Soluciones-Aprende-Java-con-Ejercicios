# Solutions-Learn-Java-with-Exercises

These are my personal solutions to the exercises in the book *Learn Java with Exercises* by José Luis Sánchez.

## Introduction

I developed this project alongside the first year of the Web Applications Development module. It has been very helpful in achieving good grades in the programming course, as well as learning more than what was taught in the class.

Initially, I used Eclipse as it is the program used in the course. Once the course ended, I tried the IntelliJ editor to experience a more modern IDE. In my opinion, IntelliJ is more comfortable and intuitive. However, the free version has many restrictions. It does not allow plugins for database access or the use of JSP and CSS, so I went back to using Eclipse from the JSP topic onward.

It is worth mentioning that, once I passed the module, I completed several exercises with the help of AI to evaluate its reliability and save time in solving problems that already have solutions.

## Conclusions

As a conclusion to this project, I have observed that AI significantly speeds up the work and saves time in searching for solutions, thus allowing learning from how it solves tasks. However, to use it, knowledge in the subject is required since these exercises are not only about writing the code. It is also necessary to know how to handle files, imports, SOLID principles, and exception handling.
